Work hard, play hard ; 
No one is to blame for your future situation but yourself;
Things may come to those who wait, but only the things left by those who hustle;
Everything comes to him who hustles while he waits;
Every sucessful person in the world is a hustler one way or another;
Invest in your dreams. Grind now. Shine later;
Hustlers don’t sleep, they nap;
Greatness only comes before hustle in the dictionary;
Without hustle, talent will only carry you so far;
Hustle in silence and let your success make the noise;
All our dreams can come true, if we have the courage to pursue them;
The secret of getting ahead is getting started;
I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life and that is why I succeed;
Don’t limit yourself;
What you believe, remember, you can achieve;
It’s hard to beat a person who never gives up;
Work hard in silence, let your success make the noise;
Hustle hard and play harder;
You will get ahead and your dreams will come true;
Greatness is the recipe for success;
